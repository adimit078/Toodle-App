This is the zennpath app.

Currently, there are 2 main versions: 
    
    Toodle
    zennpath

Toodle was the original version of the project developed in the end months of 2020, during the midst of the pandemic.
After working on Toodle for a few months, I decided to redo the app as Toodle had some bugs and the UI needed work. "zennpath" was then created. Currently, it is a work in progress.

Current zennpath summary:

    Better developed UI with navigation controllers and smooth transitions + better images/buttons
    Completed ToDo screen with updated interface, working completely
    "Feels" page nearly completed - "happy user" branch working completely with suggesitons of small toDos, etc.
    
Left to do:

    Work on the "sad user" "Feels" page branch
    Finish push notifications/toDo reminders
